# AI-Driven Risk Prediction Engine for Chronic Care Patients

A clinician-facing full-stack application that predicts hospital readmission risk (proxy for 90-day deterioration) for chronic-care patients, built with Next.js 14, React 18, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, and an explainable ML backend.


---

## üìã Overview

This application combines machine learning with a modern web interface to help clinicians identify high-risk chronic care patients before deterioration occurs. By analyzing patient demographics, lab results, medications, and medical history, it provides actionable insights to improve patient outcomes and reduce hospital readmissions.

## üéØ Key Features

### üî¨ **ML-Powered Risk Prediction**
- Random Forest classifier with explainable AI (SHAP)
- Handles class imbalance with SMOTE oversampling
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics (AUROC, AUPRC, Brier score)
- Real-time risk scoring and what-if scenario analysis

### üè• **Clinician-Focused Interface**
- **Dashboard**: Cohort-level risk metrics and population insights
- **Patient List**: Virtualized table with advanced filtering and search
- **Patient Detail**: Individual risk analysis with explainable factors
- **Add Patient**: Immediate risk assessment for new patients
- **Chat Assistant**: AI-powered clinical decision support

### ‚ö° **Performance Optimized**
- Server-side rendering with Next.js App Router
- Virtualized tables for handling large datasets
- Real-time data fetching with TanStack Query
- Responsive design optimized for clinical workflows
